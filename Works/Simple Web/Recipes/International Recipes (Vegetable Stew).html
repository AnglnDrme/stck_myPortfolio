					<dt style="font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 5px;">Dish Description:</dt>
					<dd>A combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. Ingredients in include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, poultry, sausages, and seafood. While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common. A small amount of red wine is sometimes added for flavour. Seasoning and flavourings may also be added. Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle.</dd>
