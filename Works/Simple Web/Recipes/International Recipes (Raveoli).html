					<dd>Ravioli are a type of pasta comprising a filling enveloped in thin pasta dough. Usually served in broth or with a sauce, they originated as a traditional food in Italian cuisine. Ravioli are commonly square, though other forms are also used, including circular and semi-circular (mezzelune). Traditionally, ravioli are made at home. The filling varies according to the area where they are prepared. In Rome and Latium the filling is made with ricotta cheese, spinach, nutmeg and black pepper. In Sardinia, ravioli are filled with ricotta and grated lemon rind. Modern ravioli are also mass-produced by machine.</dd>

				<ol>
					<li>In a large bowl whisk together the flour and salt.</li>

					<li>Form into a ball and leave in the bowl, covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes.</li>
					<li>Take a small piece of the dough and either run it through a pasta machine a few times OR use a rolling pin, some flour and a considerable amount of muscle to create a thin sheet.</li>
					<li>Cut circles out of the dough using a cookie cutter or a glass.</li>
					<li>Place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of half the circles.</li>
					<li>Lightly brush egg wash around the edge of the circle. Place the second circle on top over the filling and use a fork to crimp the edges all around.</li>
					<li>Continue with remaining pasta dough until all the dough or filling has been used.</li>
					<li>To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add ravioli and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
