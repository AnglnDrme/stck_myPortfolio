					<dd>Beef Wellington is a steak dish of English origin, made out of fillet steak coated with pâté and duxelles, wrapped in puff pastry, then baked. Some recipes include wrapping the coated meat in a crêpe or parma ham to retain the moisture and prevent it from making the pastry soggy. A whole tenderloin may be wrapped and baked, and then sliced for serving, or the tenderloin may be sliced into individual portions prior to wrapping and baking.</dd>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 5px; line-height: 0px;">Ingredients:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>1 (2 lb.) center-cut beef tenderloin, trimmed</li>
					<li>kosher salt</li>
					<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
					<li>Olive oil, for greasing</li>
					<li>2 tbsp. Dijon mustard</li>
					<li>1 1/2 lb. mixed mushrooms, roughly chopped</li>
					<li>1 shallot, roughly chopped</li>
					<li>Leaves from 1 thyme sprig</li>
					<li>2 tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
					<li>12 thin slices prosciutto</li>
					<li>Flour, for dusting</li>
					<li>14 oz. frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
					<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
					<li>Flaky salt, for sprinkling</li>
				</ul>

				<p style="font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 5px; line-height: 0px;">Directions:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
					<li>Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil.</li>
					<li>Once pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total).</li>
					<li>Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.</li>
					<li>Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, and thyme until finely chopped.</li>
					<li>To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and cook until liquid has evaporated, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then let cool in fridge.</li>
					<li>Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it’s twice the length and width of the tenderloin.</li>
					<li>Shingle the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that’s big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the prosciutto.</li>
					<li>Season tenderloin, then place it at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly.</li>
					<li>Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain its shape).</li>
					<li>Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you just made!).</li>
					<li>Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry.</li>
					<li>Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges with a fork to seal well.</li>
					<li>Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.</li>
					<li>Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with flaky salt.</li>
					<li>Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
					<li>Let rest 10 minutes before carving and serving.</li>
