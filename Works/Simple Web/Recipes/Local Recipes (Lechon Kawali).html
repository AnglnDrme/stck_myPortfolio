					<dd>A crispy deep-fried pork is the simplest way to describe lechon kawali. Pork belly or liempo is the cut of pork usually used to cook it. This dish is best served for lunch or dinner with white rice on the side. It is also nice to have with dipping sauce. This dish should not be mistaken with Lechon, which is considered as the national dish of the Philippines. Both dishes are prepared in a different manner. These also have different visual appearance.</dd>

				<p style="font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 5px; line-height: 0px;">Ingredients:</p>
				<ul type="disc">
					<li>2 lbs. pork belly</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
					<li>2 tablespoons whole pepper corn</li>
					<li>5 pieces dried bay leaves</li>
					<li>3 cups cooking Oil</li>
					<li>34 ounces Water</li>
				</ul>

				<p style="font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 5px; line-height: 0px;">Directions:</p>
				<ol>

					<li>Add the pork belly and 1 tablespoon of salt. Put some pepper pepper and bay leaves. Boil for 30 minutes or until meat gets tender.</li>
					<li>Remove the meat from the pot and let it cool down for a few minutes.</li>
					<li>Spread 1 tablespoon of salt on the pork belly. Make sure to distribute it evenly on all sections.</li>
					<li>Start to deep fry the boiled meat. Heat oil on a cooking pot.</li>
					<li>Put each piece of boiled pork belly into the hot oil with extra caution. Fry until crispy. Turn the meat over to completely fry the opposite side until crispy. Note: be extra careful when frying as oil can splatter. You can use the cover of the pot to cover it while oil splatters, but do not cover completely as steam will be trapped. It will cause more splatters.</li>

					<li>Serve with lechon sauce. Share and Enjoy!</li>
