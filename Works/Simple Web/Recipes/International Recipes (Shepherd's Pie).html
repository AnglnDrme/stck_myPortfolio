					<li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. Make mashed potatoes: In a large pot, cover potatoes with water and add a generous pinch of salt.</li>
					<li>Bring to a boil and cook until totally soft, 16 to 18 minutes. Drain and return to pot.</li>
					<li>Use a potato masher to mash potatoes until smooth. Add melted butter, milk, and sour cream.</li>
					<li>Mash together until fully incorporated, then season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
					<li>Make beef mixture: In a large, ovenproof skillet over medium heat, heat oil.</li>

					<li>Stir in frozen peas and corn and cook until warmed through, 3 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
					<li>Sprinkle meat with flour and stir to evenly distribute. Cook 1 minute more and add chicken broth. Bring to a simmer and let mixture thicken slightly, 5 minutes.</li>
