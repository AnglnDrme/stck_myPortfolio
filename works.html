						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">I made this work way back 2020 wherein I have a plety of time to spare because of the pandemic.
						I saw some people changing their Facebook profiles to a "Cartoon" version of themselves.
						Due to curiosity, my creative mind pushed me to follow the trend that time.
						By the time I'm making this, I'm still new to Adobe Photoshop so it took me hours to finish this work.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="grid1_list" style="position: abosolute;">
						<center>
							<img src="Works/Edits/cartoon2.jpg" class="cartoon" alt="Cartoon 2">

						</center>	
						
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">This was made right after I finish my first work.
						I tried to put additional details to this work such as facial features.
						I tried to add a shadow to this work but unfortunately, I'm still not good at editing on Photoshop.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="grid1_list" style="position: abosolute;">

							<img src="Works/Edits/cartoon3.jpg" class="cartoon" alt="Cartoon 3">

						</center>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">This work is one of my least favorites
						but I'm still proud of what I've done since it shows my progress on my editing skills.
						I added shadows to this work this time unlike the first two works that I made.</p>

						</center>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">When the time pandemic had just begun,
						people are not allowed to go outside because of the quarantine.
						Since then I'm always in my home, I always reminiscing about the times where I can freely spend my time with my friends.
						Our trip in National Museum way back 2018 was the first thing popped in my head that time.
						So I decided to make this artwork to relive that moment. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="grid1_list" style="position: abosolute;">

							<img src="Works/Edits/cartoon5.jpg" class="cartoon" alt="Cartoon 5">

						</center>	
						
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">As I remiscize the past, I missed hanging out with my friends.
						And among the list of friends that I have, there is one person that I've been friends with for a very long time.
						We've met in high school and were become friends ever since.
						So I decide to make this work back then because I really miss hanging out with my friends, especially my bestfriend.</p>

					<div class="grid1_list" style="position: abosolute;">

							<img src="Works/Edits/cartoon6.jpg" class="cartoon" alt="Cartoon 6">

							<p style="font-size: 30px; color: #b23737;">Cartoon 6</p>
						</center>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">I remember that it has been a year after I graduated senior high school when I made this.
						As I remember every ups and downs that I need to take in order for me to reach what I am now.
						So I decided to make this work to tell my future self that no matter how difficult her situation now, she can finish them just as how she overcome the problems she faced in the past.</p>

						</center>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">I made this work as a gift for my bestfriend on her birthday last 2020.
						I have nothing to give her that time so I decided to make a cartoon version of her Facebook profile back then.
						As I see this work, I realize that this is my best works so far.
						It shows my progress from zero knowledge to beginner to intermidiatte level of editing in photoshop.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">I'm always in charge of editing my group's PowerPoint presentations.
						I usually use simple designs but I always make sure that every slide is pleasing to the eyes even though the layout is very simple.
						My group was tasked to chose a local story, poem or song that reminds us to our childhood and explain why we chose that.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">I was once again in charge of editing my group's deck for our speech in one of my subjects this semester.
						Our theme is about the different places to visit in the Philippines so I make our presentation looked like a tourist tour with us as their tourist guides. </p>

						In this webpage, we were tasked to create 10 international and local dishes and make a page on every one of them that will serve as our prelim exam.
						The webpage however is not responsive since I do not know how to do that back then.</p>

						</center>	
						
						<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">We were tasked to make a food menu in html so I made a simple food menu.
						It may seem too simple or too dull since that it doesn't look like the other food menu webpages that you can see on the internet.
						I'm still learning that time on how to make a good webpage since I have to watch a lot of tutorial videos about HTML and CSS basics.</p>
